# ZMK Configuration for the Quark Keyboard
#

# -- Core Functionality --
# This ensures the keyboard identifies as "Quark", matching your Kconfig.defconfig.
# Remove the '#' and change the name if you prefer something else like "echo".
# CONFIG_ZMK_KEYBOARD_NAME="Quark"

# Enable basic media keys (play/pause, volume)
CONFIG_ZMK_HID_CONSUMER_REPORT_USAGES_BASIC=y


# -- Power Management --
# Enable ZMK's power management features
CONFIG_ZMK_SLEEP=y

# Time to wait before entering idle state (e.g., turning off displays). 30s default.
# Your value of 1 hour is very long; using 5 minutes (300000ms) is a good compromise.
CONFIG_ZMK_IDLE_TIMEOUT=1800000

# Time to wait in idle state before entering deep sleep. 15min default.
# Your value of 3 hours would significantly impact battery life.
# Using the default of 15 minutes (900000ms) is highly recommended.
CONFIG_ZMK_IDLE_SLEEP_TIMEOUT=3600000

# Enable battery level reporting over BLE
CONFIG_ZMK_BATTERY_REPORTING=y


# -- Bluetooth & Wireless --
# Set Bluetooth transmit power. +8 is the maximum, good for overcoming
# connection issues but uses more battery. A value of 0 is a good default.
CONFIG_BT_CTLR_TX_PWR_PLUS_8=y


# -- ZMK Studio & Debugging --
# Explicitly enable ZMK Studio support.
# While this is set in build.yaml, it's good practice to have here for local builds.
CONFIG_ZMK_STUDIO=y

# Enable USB logging. Very useful for debugging.
# To see logs, connect via USB and use a serial monitor (e.g., 'west espressif monitor').
# Keep this disabled for normal use to save power and firmware space.
# CONFIG_ZMK_USB_LOGGING=y
